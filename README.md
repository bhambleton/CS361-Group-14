To run the server:

1) If you want to do DB queries, make sure you're VPN'd into sds.oregonstate.edu.
2) Run "npm install" via OS cmd line or your IDE's cmd line in the repo's root directory (where the package.json file lives).
3) Execute the file app/server/serverMain.js in your IDE.

Server interaction options:
a) View server-generated pages for testing: point your browser to http://localhost:8657
b) Hit the server from a separate client: Run the file app/client/clientPOSTtest.html
