To run the server:

1) If you want to do DB queries, make sure you're VPN'd into sds.oregonstate.edu.
2) Run "npm install" via OS cmd line or your IDE's cmd line in the repo's root directory (where the package.json file lives).
3) Execute the file app/server/serverMain.js in your IDE.
4) Point your browser to http://localhost:8657
   - this is just the default server run location. Change the line "app.set('port', 8657);" in serverMain.js if desired.
